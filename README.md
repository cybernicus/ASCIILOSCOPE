# ASCIILOSCOPE
An oscilloscope in ASCII

The objective of this utility is to create a real time graphical monitoring of changing data from a terminal. The target applications may be monitoring electrical signals.  Clearly this is not as representative as a true graphical display, but it allows a simple illustration of input changes.  For my purposes it will allow me to select multipliers and offsets adjustments for signal captures by sensors for other applications.  It is also a test bed for the Curses Sprites and eventual PerlayStation Terminal Games Console

Ihe display can be positioned and sized as needed. The Keyboard is monitored for functions to be added as development continues

Things to do: -

* Manual scale and offset adjustment
* Manual sample rate adjustment
* Autoscaling is already implemented
* Drift adjustment
* Multiple traces
* Triggers and Storage modes
