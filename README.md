# ASCIILOSCOPE
An oscilloscope in ASCII

The objective of this utility is to create a real time graphical monitoring of changing data from a terminal. The target applications may be monitoring electrical signals.  Clearly this is not as representative as a true graphical display, but it allows a simple illustration of input changes.  For my purposes it allows me to select multipliers and offsets adjustments for signal captures by sensors for other applications.
